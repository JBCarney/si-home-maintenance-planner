# si-home-maintenance-planner

Snap Interactive full-stack home maintenance planner.

## Overview

This is a simple home maintenance planner application that I am creating with the intention
of not only creating a working application, but also to document my process of how I orchestrate
different frameworks, tools and platforms together with specific development patterns that record 
the history and progress of the application. Frequent checkins along with BDD unit and integration 
testing (I will not be covering functional testing) will show, step-by-step, the development of this
application.    

It is not often that I get to create a brand new application with all of my current favorites, and two new 
technologies (Sequelize and SQLite), so this is going to be fun!

## Tools and Frameworks
- Visual Studio Code (Lightweight, robust and a built in Terminal for kicking off processes. Awesome!)
- Node.js: Comming from the .NET side I was supprised how much I like Nodejs.
- Express: Going with the old standard for node here.
- React, Redux, Thunk and Saga: I have worked with AngularJS 1.x and 2 and I prefer React's less opinionated approach.
- Bootstrap and SASS: I am not a designer but I like my projects to look like they wern't created by a backend developer.
- Sequelize: I know I have not used this before. I am anticipating it being a bit simpler than EF.
- SQLite: I don't recall using this before so it will be interesting.
- ESLint: This can be annoying until the team agrees on standards. The Airbnb standard seems to be a good start usually.
- Babel: I like Babel over TypeScript/CoffeeScript because it transpiles without having to memorize yet another language.
- Jest: Mocha and Chia were my first thoughts for testing and assertion frameworks but Jest is gaining popularity and is from the Facebook team so I think this would be a good opportunity to check it out.
- Chalk: Provides color highlighting in the terminal to help make errors and warnings stand out.
- Webpack: Almost magical bundler and soon it will include Tree Shaking!
- NPM-Scripts: Implements in the package.json and removes the need for extra libraries like Grunt and Gulp.
- Travis CI: Compiles, reports and runs the application on a Linux environment. Integrates with GitHub. 
- Appveyor: Compiles, reports and runs the application on a Windows environment. Integrates with GitHub.
- Surge: Provides a development, static file CDN for the application's UI. Integrates with GitHub. 
- Track:js: This service provides error reports when application is running in production environment.
- GitHub: So many reasons. Source control, project collaboration, etc...
